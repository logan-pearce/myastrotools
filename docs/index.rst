  myastrotools
========

myastrotools is a collection of python functions I've made for doing
various this in astronomical research.  It's mainly for me, but other
users may find the corner plot and common proper motion plots
especially useful.  If I made a function in python that I had to use
over and over in different contexts, I added to this package.

Tutorials on using the corner plot and common proper motion plots can
be found here: https://github.com/logan-pearce/myastrotools
